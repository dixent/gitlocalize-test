To do this, first **change** the `type` of the [`amp-carousel`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.md) from `carousel` to `slides`, **change** the `layout` to `responsive` and **set** the `width` to 300 (ensuring it has both a `height` and `width` defined).  **Add** the `"layout=responsive"` attribute to the [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) children of the [`amp-carousel`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.md).
